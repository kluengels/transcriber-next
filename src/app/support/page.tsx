              HANS is able to process common audio and video file types. Behind
              the scenes video files are converted into audio files and big

              might consider splitting it into smaller chunks by yourself. This

              We have done our best to make HANS as safe as possible. However
              HANS is still in developement and we recommend not using the app
              for any kind of sensitive, confidential recordings. Our database
              is hosted on a virtual private server located in Germany. The
              text-to-speech-transformation is achieved via an application
              programming interface (API) to OpenAI. The company may use servers
              in the USA or other countries.
